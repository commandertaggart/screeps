Workers

Worker creeps are involved in shuttling energy from one place to another. this
breaks down their task into two arms: collect and deliver.  Each arm may be
subdivided if some traffic control is needed.

Part 1: Analysis
The desired task is analyzed using these steps:
- Determine if work is needed.  If not, pick another job and start over.
- Determine the location of the work.  Pick a construction site, energy store,
etc., and the energy source closest to it.  Also determine if there are staging
areas for the source or destination.
- Initiate a work cycle.

Part 2: Work Cycle
Complete one cycle of work:
- If there is a staging area for the source, travel there and wait your turn.
- Travel to the source and collect energy.
- If there is a staging area for the destination, travel there and wait your turn.
- Travel to the destination and deliver.
- Start again with analysis.

State Machine

This process is driven by a state machine, giving each creep one thing to do
at a time, with any subsequently needed information stored in memory.

Each state is represented by a task function.
